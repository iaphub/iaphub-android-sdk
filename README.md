## Installation

Implementing In-app purchases in your app should be a piece of cake!<br/>

1. Create an account on [IAPHUB](https://www.iaphub.com)

2. Add the library to your `build.gradle` file
```
implementation 'com.iaphub:iaphub-android-sdk:2.0.3'
```

3. Follow the instructions below

## Start
Import `Iaphub` and start the library in the `onCreate` method of your application<br/>

```kotlin
package com.iaphub.example

import android.app.Application
import com.iaphub.Iaphub

class MainApplication: Application()  {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // Start IAPHUB
        Iaphub.start(
          // Required, the app id is available on the settings page of your app
          appId="5e4890f6c61fc971cf46db4d",
          
          // Required, the (client) api key is available on the settings page of your app
          apiKey="SDp7aY220RtzZrsvRpp4BGFm6qZqNkNf",
          
          // Optional, the user id, if you do not specify one an anonymous id will be generated (id prefixed with 'a:')
          // You can provide it if the user is already logged in on app start
          userId="42",

          // Optional, ff you want to allow purchases when the user has an anonymous user id
          // If you're listenning to IAPHUB webhooks your implementation must support users with anonymous user ids
          // This option is disabled by default, when disabled the buy method will return an error when the user isn't logged in
          allowAnonymousPurchase=true
        )
    }
}
```

## Events
IAPHUB is exposing different events<br/>
They are all optional but `setOnUserUpdateListener` is highly recommended in order to know when to refresh the state of your products.

#### User update
```kotlin
  Iaphub.setOnUserUpdateListener { ->
    // Called when the user has already been fetch and is updated
    // It means the products for sale or active products are different from the one you previously loaded using getProductsForSale/getActiveProducts
    // You should refresh your view with the new state of your products

    // When using the login/logout method, the user is reset, meaning this event won't be called until the user has been loaded first using the getProductsForSale/getActiveProducts methods
  }
```

#### Error
```kotlin
  Iaphub.setOnErrorListener { ->
    // Called when IAPHUB has detected an error
    // It can be interesting to log unexpected errors
  }
```

#### Receipt
```kotlin
  Iaphub.setOnReceiptListener { ->
    // Called after a receipt has been processed
  }
```

## Login
Call the `login` method to authenticate an user.<br/>

‚ö† You should provide an id that is non-guessable and isn't public. (Email not allowed)<br/>

‚ö† The user will be reset, `setOnUserUpdateListener` will only be called until after the user has been loaded first (using getProductsForSale/getActiveProducts).<br/>

```kotlin
Iaphub.login("3e4890f6c72fc971cf46db5d") { err: IaphubError? ->
  // On a success the err should be null
}
```

## Logout
Call the `logout` method to log the user out.<br/>
The user will switch back to his anonymous user id (prefixed with 'a:').<br/>

‚ö† The user will be reset, `setOnUserUpdateListener` will only be called until after the user has been loaded first (using getProductsForSale/getActiveProducts).<br/>

```kotlin
Iaphub.logout()
```

## Set user tags
Call the `setUserTags` method to update the user tags.<br/>
User tags will appear on the user page of the IAPHUB dashboard.<br/>
When using IAPHUB's [smart listings](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/resources/smart-listing), you'll be able to return different products depending on the user tags.<br/>

‚ö† This method will throw an error if the tag name hasn't been created on the IAPHUB dashboard

```kotlin
// To set a tag
Iaphub.setUserTags(mapOf("gender" to "male")) { err: IaphubError? ->
  // On a success the err should be null
}

// To remove a tag pass a empty string
Iaphub.setUserTags(mapOf("gender" to "")) { err: IaphubError? ->
  // On a success the err should be null
}
```

A few details:
  - A tag must be created on the IAPHUB dashboard (otherwise the method will throw an error)
  - When creating a tag on the IAPHUB dashboard you must check the option to allow editing the tag from the client (otherwise you'll only be able to edit the tag using the [IAPHUB API](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/api/post-user) from your server)
  - A tag key is limited to 32 characters
  - A tag value is limited to 64 characters

## Set device params
Call the `setDeviceParams` method to set parameters for the device<br/>
When using IAPHUB's [smart listings](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/resources/smart-listing), you'll be able to return different products depending on the device params.

```kotlin
// For instance you can provide the app version on app launch
// Useful to return a product only supported in a new version
Iaphub.setDeviceParams(mapOf("appVersion" to "2.0.0"))
// To clear the device params
Iaphub.setDeviceParams(mapOf())
```

A few details:
  - The params are not saved on the device, they won't persist if the app is restarted
  - The params are not saved on IAPHUB, they are just provided to the API when fetching the products for sale
  - A param key limited to 32 characters and must be a valid key (``^[a-zA-Z_]*$``)
  - A param value limited to 32 characters
  - You can provide up to 5 params

## Get products for sale
Call the ``getProductsForSale`` method to get the user's products for sale<br/>
You should use this method when displaying the page with the list of your products for sale.

‚ö† If the request fails because of a network issue, the method returns the latest request in cache (if available, otherwise an error is thrown).

‚ö† If a product is returned by the [API](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/api/get-user/) but the sku cannot be loaded, it'll be filtered from the list and an 'unexpected' error will be returned in the `setOnErrorListener` listener.

```kotlin
Iaphub.getProductsForSale { err: IaphubError?, products: List<Product>? ->
  // On a success err should be null
}
```

## Get active products
If you're relying on IAPHUB on the client side (instead of using your server with webhooks) to detect if the user has active products (auto-renewable subscriptions, non-renewing subscriptions or non-consumables), you should use the `getActiveProducts` method.<br/>

‚ö† If the request fails because of a network issue, the method returns the latest request in cache (if available with no expired subscription, otherwise an error is thrown).

‚ö† If an active product is returned by the API but the sku cannot be loaded, the product will be returned but only with the properties coming from the [API](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/api/get-user/) (The price, title, description.... properties won't be returned).

#### Subscription state

Value | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------
| active | The subscription is active
| grace_period | The subscription is in the grace period, the user should still access the features offered by your subscription
| retry_period | The subscription is in the retry period, you must restrict the access to the features offered by your subscription and display a message asking for the user to update its payment informations.
| paused | The subscription is paused and will automatically resume at a later date (`autoResumeDate` property), you must restrict the access to the features offered by your subscription.

By default only subscriptions with an `active` or `grace_period` state are returned by the `getActiveProducts` method because you must restrict the access to the features offered by your subscription on a `retry_period` or `paused` state.<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking to display a message when a user has a subscription on a `retry_period` or `paused` state, you can use the `includeSubscriptionStates` option.
```swift
  Iaphub.getActiveProducts(includeSubscriptionStates=listOf("retry_period", "paused")) { err: IaphubError?, products: List<ActiveProduct>? ->
    // On a success err should be null
  }
```

## Get products
A method `getProducts` is also available in order to get the products for sale and active products in one call.
```swift
  Iaphub.getProducts() { err: IaphubError?, productsForSale: List<Product>?, activeProducts: List<ActiveProduct>? ->
    // On a success err should be null
  }
```

## Buy a product
Call the ``buy`` method to buy a product<br/><br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è The method needs the product sku that you would get from one of the products of `getProductsForSale`.<br/>

```kotlin
  Iaphub.buy(activity=requireActivity(), sku=product.sku) { err: IaphubError?, transaction: ReceiptTransaction? ->
    var message: String? = null

    if (err != null) {
      if (err.code == "user_cancelled" || err.code == "product_already_purchased") {
        // No need to show a message here
      }
      // The billing is unavailable (An iPhone can be restricted from accessing the Apple App Store)
      else if (err.code == "billing_unavailable") {
        message = "In-app purchase not allowed"
      }
      // The product has already been bought but it's owned by a different user, restore needed to transfer it to this user
      else if (err.code == "product_owned_different_user") {
        message = "You already purchased this product but it is currently used by a different account, restore your purchases to transfer it to this account"
      }
      // The payment has been deferred (awaiting approval from parental control)
      else if (err.code == "deferred_payment") {
        message = "Your purchase is awaiting approval from the parental control"
      }
      /*
        * The remote server couldn't be reached properly
        * The user will have to restore its purchases in order to validate the transaction
        * An automatic restore should be triggered on every relaunch of your app since the transaction hasn't been 'finished'
        */
      else if (err.code == "network_error") {
        message = "Please try to restore your purchases later (Button in the settings) or contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
      }
      /*
        * The receipt has been processed on IAPHUB but something went wrong
        * It is probably because of an issue with the configuration of your app or a call to the Itunes/GooglePlay API that failed
        * IAPHUB will send you an email notification when a receipt fails, by checking the receipt on the dashboard you'll find a detailed report of the error
        * After fixing the issue (if there's any), just click on the 'New report' button in order to process the receipt again
        * If it is an error contacting the Itunes/GooglePlay API, IAPHUB will retry to process the receipt automatically as well
        */
      else if (err.code == "receipt_failed") {
        message = "We're having trouble validating your transaction, give us some time we'll retry to validate your transaction ASAP!"
      }
      /*
        * The receipt has been processed on IAPHUB but is invalid
        * It could be a fraud attempt, using apps such as Freedom or Lucky Patcher on an Android rooted device
        */
      else if (err.code == "receipt_invalid") {
        message = "We were not able to process your purchase, if you've been charged please contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
      }
      /*
        * The user has already an active subscription on a different platform (android or ios)
        * This security has been implemented to prevent a user from ending up with two subscriptions of different platforms
        * You can disable the security by providing the 'crossPlatformConflict' parameter to the buy method (Iaphub.buy(sku: sku, crossPlatformConflict: false))
      */
      else if (err.code == "cross_platform_conflict") {
        message = "Seems like you already have a subscription on a different platform\nYou have to use the same platform to change your subscription or wait for your current subscription to expire";
      }
      /*
        * The transaction is successful but the product belongs to a different user
        * You should ask the user to use the account with which he originally bought the product or ask him to restore its purchases in order to transfer the previous purchases to the new account
        */
      else if (err.code == "user_conflict") {
        message = "Product owned by a different user\nPlease use the account with which you originally bought the product or restore your purchases"
      }
    }
    // If there is no error, check the webhook status (if it is enabled)
    else {
      if (transaction?.webhookStatus != "failed") {
        message = "Purchase successful!"
      }
      else {
        message = "Your purchase was successful but we need some more time to validate it, should arrive soon! Otherwise contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
      }
    }
    // Show message
    if (message != null) {
      Toast.makeText(application, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
  }
```

## Restore user purchases
Call the ``restore`` method to restore the user purchases<br/><br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è You must display a button somewhere in your app in order to allow the user to restore its purchases.<br/>

```kotlin
Iaphub.restore { err: IaphubError? ->
  // On a success err should be null
}
```
